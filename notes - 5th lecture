best industry practises
1. make new component for every function.
2.all the source code keep in src folder.
3.keep all components in one component folder.
4. keep component first letter in capital must.
5 .keep file name exact same as function name.
6. use file extension weather js or jsx not matters.
7. always keep hardcoded data in saperate file.
always keep names in capital .

8. two types of export 1.default export-one file have only one file  an be default export.

 2.named export-a file can have multiple named export.or in other words if we need to export multiple things export from one file then we use it.

what is state or useState?
 9.whenever state veriable changes react rerender component.
setState() this method allows us to update state of component.

 11.useState(), onclick event , virtual dom , recounciliation(react fiber)

 react hoooks - they are prebuild functions which provides advantage to developers while developing ui.


 *virtual Dom - it is representation of actual dom.it is nothig but normal javascript object.
 
diffing algorithm - it finds out difference between newly updated Virtual DOM with the previous version of the Virtual DOM. 

*reconsiliation algoritham(also known as react fiber)?
recounciliation algorithm efficiently updates ui using virtual dom and diffing algorithm by minimizing direct interaction with real dom this makes faster rendering.



what makes react application fast?
1 react is very fast in dom operation/it do effcient dom manipulation.
