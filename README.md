//hello namsate react

notes - 13

for small and mid level application redux is not necessory.

react and redux anre two different libraries.
zustand library is also used for state manegement.

to installl redux we need to install two libraries
1.react-redux
2.redux tool kit --it is standard way of writting redux.

Redux store is whole big object and is is kept at central place so that any component can access data from it.

slices - it is logical separation inside store to keep data neatly.

steps to configre redux tool kit
1. install react-redux nad redux tool kit
2.build store -- it is generall created inside constant/utils folder
3.



while subscribing to redux store (useselector) subscribe to right portion of redux store otherwise it create big performnce loss.
